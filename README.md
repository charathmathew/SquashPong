# SquashPong
### A squash version of the classic game of pong

Uses the pygame library: https://www.pygame.org/

A single player pong game where the ball bounces off three walls (top, left and bottom). You control the pong paddle with your mouse. Try to keep the ball away from the red boundary on the right.

Possible future improvements:
1. Add a game over/play again screen
1. Add a second paddle for multiplayer
1. Implement a way to play against CPU
1. Add some sort of points system
